"""Can each paper gate actually fail?

Every other gate here asks whether the paper is right. None asks whether the
gates are. That question is not hypothetical: check_self_consistency passed a
paper claiming "Ninety-nine retractions are marked in place below" and again
one claiming "Three", because its pattern only matched sentences carrying a
retraction verb and its number-word dictionary stopped at twenty — an
unreadable count was skipped in silence rather than reported. It had been
green for weeks over a document whose count it could not read.

This injects a defect each gate is supposed to catch, runs the gate, and
requires it to fail. A gate that passes its own defect is reported here, in
CI, instead of being discovered by whoever eventually trusts it.

THE MISTAKE THIS FILE EXISTS TO PREVENT, MADE THREE TIMES BY ITS AUTHOR:
a string replacement whose target is absent is a no-op, the gate then passes
because nothing was injected, and the output is identical to a gate that has
gone blind. check_withdrawn_live's docstring warned about it in prose; the
warning was ignored twice more anyway. So every injection here asserts the
file actually changed before the gate is allowed to speak, and a no-op
injection is a failure of THIS file, not a pass of the gate.
