r"""Does every workflow step's shell script parse?

A `run:` script with a syntax error does not fail at review time, it fails
when it runs -- and two steps here only run on `workflow_dispatch`, so their
errors sat unseen:

  - build-matrix.yml "Full bitstream build": a `doesn't` in a comment inside
    `bash -c '...'` closed the single-quoted script, and the rest of it was
    read as the outer shell's;
  - iddr-golden-diff.yml "Build the same design with openXC7 and diff the
    ILOGIC config": the `'\''` idiom, which only means "a quote" INSIDE single
    quotes, was used on a line outside them and left one quote open.

Both steps failed on parse every time they were dispatched. This gate runs
`bash -n` (or `sh -n` for `shell: sh`) on every step whose effective shell is
a POSIX one -- the step's `shell:`, else the job's, else the workflow's
`defaults.run.shell`, read through `/usr/bin/env [-opts] [VAR=x]`. With no
`shell:` anywhere it is bash; pwsh on a `windows` runner, which is skipped;
and in a `container:` job, bash only if the image has it and `sh` if not -- so
there the script is checked with BOTH, and a bashism needs an explicit
`shell: bash`. `${{ ... }}` is left as written: `bash -n` does not expand it.
A job that may run on macOS (bash 3.2 for `bash` and `sh`) is "cannot tell"
unless the gate's own bash is 3.x.
A `shell:` line that does not split into words is "cannot tell".

`bash -n` reads syntax only: a script inside a quoted `bash -c '...'` argument
is one string to it, so an error INSIDE that string is not seen -- unless, as
in both cases above, it breaks the quoting of the outer script.

Exit 0 clean, 1 a step that does not parse, 2 a workflow this could not read
(cannot tell is not clean). tools/test_check_run_syntax.py plants every case.
