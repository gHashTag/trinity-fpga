tnf_ladder_versions.py — versioned TNF ladder definitions.

Why this file exists
--------------------
`tnf_ref.py` shipped a single `LADDER` dictionary whose mantissa widths came
from the research note.  Seven of its nine rungs do not satisfy the width rule
the specification states, `1 + E_t + M = N`:

    rung      shipped (E_t, M)   1+E_t+M    N
    TNF16     (4,  9)            14         16
    TNF32     (5, 21)            27         32
    TNF64     (7, 52)            60         64
    TNF128    (8, 115)          124        128
    TNF256    (9, 242)          252        256
    TNF512    (10, 497)         508        512
    TNF1024   (11, 1006)       1018       1024

Silently repairing the dictionary would change every conformance vector and
therefore every published SHA-256 digest, so the repair is a *versioned* change
and both ladders stay addressable by name:

    LADDER_V1_RESEARCH  frozen, byte-compatible with what shipped
    LADDER_V2_SPEC      derived from the width rule, not typed in by hand

A conformance transcript is only meaningful together with the ladder version and
the digest of the vector file it was produced from.  `VECTOR_SPEC_VERSION` below
is what a transcript must quote.
