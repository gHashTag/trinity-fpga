> **Trinity Orchestrator** — Golden Ratio mathematics meets computational physics and AI. Links all Trinity micro-repositories via `build.zig.zon`.

## 🎯 What is Trinity?

Trinity is the main orchestrator connecting a family of focused micro-repositories. Each repo has a single responsibility and can be used independently.

## 💻 Using a Module Independently

Each micro-repo is a standalone Zig package. To use any module independently:

```zig
// build.zig.zon
.dependencies = .{
    .zig_golden_float = .{
        .url = "https://github.com/gHashTag/zig-golden-float/archive/refs/heads/main.tar.gz",
    },
},
```

```bash
zig fetch --save https://github.com/gHashTag/zig-golden-float/archive/refs/heads/main.tar.gz
```
