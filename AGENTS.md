# AGENTS.md — Trinity 27-Agent Alphabet

**Version**: 2.0
**Date**: 2026-04-04
**Status**: Active

> *27 agents = 27 registers = 27 letters = TRINITY³*

---

## TRINITY ALPHABET — 27 AGENTS

The Trinity system operates with 27 named agents — one per register in `isa/registers.t27` (Coptic / Trinity alphabet).

- Each AGENT_X is bound to a letter/register
- Has its own domain area (physics, numeric, compiler, graph, experience, verdict, bench, DePIN, UI, etc.)
- Logs in `.trinity/experience/` and is linked to `graph_v2.json` nodes

---

## AGENT T — QUEEN TRINITY

**AGENT T** — the queen of TRINITY, the central orchestrator.

- **Module**: `t27/specs/queen/lotus.t27` — 6-phase orchestration
- **Letter**: TAW (ת) — CROSS/SIGNATURE, the last letter of the Hebrew alphabet
- **Register**: r20 (in the 27-register set)
- **Archetype**: Seal, truth, completion (EMET = Aleph + Mem + Taw)

### Responsibilities

1. **Orchestration** — reads `graph_v2.json` and knows the dependencies of all modules
2. **Task distribution** — conducts 26 sub-agents (A…Z, except T) across their domains
3. **Results collection** — gathers results (tests, verdicts, benches, experience episodes)
4. **Invariant checking** — validates architecture invariants (topological order, sacred-core, phi-critical edges)
5. **De-Zigfication enforcement** — demands that the source of truth lives in `.t27/.tri`, while Zig/Verilog/C are only backends

### Words of the Trinity

- **T-R-I-N-I-T-Y** = "Truth of mind, acting through numbers, acting in truth, bringing harvest"
- **T+F+V** = "seal + nail + discernment" = verification
- **T+A+S** = "queen + architect + standardizer" = constitution

Any large operation (NUMERIC-STANDARD-001, SACRED-PHYSICS-001, De-Zigfication, GoldenFloat Family) always goes through AGENT T.

## EXECUTION OF THE ENGINEERING LAYER

### AGENT T — ACTIVE COMMANDS

```bash
# Launch the 6-phase cycle
tri queen lotus --phase plan --task "NUMERIC-STANDARD-001"
tri queen lotus --phase assign
tri queen lotus --phase run
tri queen lotus --phase test
tri queen lotus --phase verdict
tri queen lotus --phase evolve

# Delegating to agents
tri agent assign <task> --agent A  # Architecture
tri agent assign <task> --agent N  # Numeric
tri agent assign <task> --agent P  # Physics
tri agent assign <task> --agent F  # Conformance

# Getting status
tri queen lotus --status
tri queen lotus --agents  # Show status of all agents
tri queen lotus --graph    # Show graph_v2.json impact
```

### COORDINATION BY LETTERS

Example: task "Fix PHI in constants.t27" → Agent T:

1. **Phase 1 (Plan)**: T reads graph_v2.json → sees that a change in math/constants (node 4) will affect sacred_physics (node 16), nn/attention (node 7), nn/hslm (node 8), numeric/gf16 (node 2)
2. **Phase 2 (Assign)**: T assigns:
   - **P** (Physics): fix PHI in constants.t27
   - **F** (Conformance): update the sacred_physics_*.json vectors
   - **G** (Graph): update graph metrics after the change
3. **Phase 3 (Run)**: Agents P, F, G execute tasks in parallel
4. **Phase 4 (Test)**: F checks conformance, G measures impact
5. **Phase 5 (Verdict)**: V analyzes whether the change is toxic (does it change the invariant φ² + 1/φ² = 3?)
6. **Phase 6 (Evolve)**: E records the experience, W seals the tri cell commit

## NUMERICAL STRUCTURE OF THE ALPHABET

27 = 3³ = the cube of the Trinity. Among the Pythagoreans, 27 is a sacred number.

**None I: Foundation (A–I)** — values 1–9
```
Bull → House → Camel → Door → Window → Nail → Return → Fence → Hand
Arch → Build → Comp → DeZig → Experience → Conform → Graph → HSLM → ISA
```

**None II: Organism (J–R)** — values 10–90
```
Jobs → Kernel → Language → Metrics → Numeric → Orchestration → Physics → Queue → Runtime
Routing → FPGA → Syntax → Telemetry → GoldenFloat → Phases → Sacred → Sched → Run
```

**None III: Completion (S–27th)** — values 100–900+
```

## HISTORICAL PARALLELS

### Greek letter-numeration (27 signs)

The Greek alphabet historically used 27 signs for the numbers 1–999:
- **24 classical letters** (Α–Ω) — units (1–9) and tens (10–90)
- **3 archaic letters** (Ϝ = 6, ϟ = 90, ϡ = 900) — hundreds

This gives a "proof-of-27": 27 is not magic, but a historically working format for encoding a space of values.

### The Coptic alphabet

The Coptic alphabet = 24 Greek letters + 7 demotic (from ancient Egyptian writing).

- **7 demotic letters** encode sounds that do not exist in Greek
- A legacy of 3000 years of Egyptian tradition
- Coptic = the first language to unite western rationalism (Greece) and sacred wisdom (Egypt)

**The 27th letter Ϯ (Ti)** — the only purely Coptic one:
- Form: a cross with a transverse bar (≈ the Egyptian ankh ☥)
- Meaning: "to give", "gift", "sacred gift"
- In Trinity: the agent of the future gift (security, AAIF-compliance)

---

## φ² + 1/φ² = 3 = TRINITY

The alphabet of agents is not just a list of modules, but a **mental model** of the system. Each letter = an archetype with a 4000-year history.

When you say "AGENT P is broken", you are saying "the mouth pronounces crooked laws".

When you say "AGENT T has finished", you are saying "the cross has been set upon the work".

## Own language first

When this project publishes something about itself, it publishes in **this
project's own language and format** -- not translated into somebody else's.

Owner's rule, 2026-09-20: stop writing in other people's languages, we have our
own.

This bites on any file whose only reason to exist is that an outside tool
expects that shape: `llms.txt`, `agents.json`, `ai.txt`, `.well-known/*.json`,
A2A agent cards, `ai-plugin` manifests, OpenAPI stubs, JSON-LD blocks, a README
that restates a spec. The reflex is to write four of them in four foreign
formats, and the reflex is wrong: a project whose claim is "here is a language
worth writing" and which then describes itself in three of other people's
formats has published three documents that are not true of it.

**The move:** find the address the outside world already fetches, then serve our
own language at it. `/llms.txt` at t27.ai **is** a t27 module -- `llms.txt`
requires nothing but text, and every prose line of a `.t27` file is a `;`
comment, so it stays readable to anything that cannot compile it.

**Three qualifications, so the rule stays honest:**

- A format a resolver genuinely parses -- a sitemap, `package.json`, a lockfile
  -- is machinery, not a description. **Generate** it from our own source; never
  hand-write it into a second home for the truth.
- Code against someone else's API uses their types. Prose for a human who has
  never heard of the project uses that human's language.
- If a format demands a claim we cannot back, **publish nothing**. An A2A card
  with no A2A server behind it is a false claim, and a missing file is more
  honest than a lying one.

The test: *is this file the project speaking about itself?* If yes, it speaks
our language. If it is plumbing, it speaks the plumbing's.

**Worked example, compiler-checked rather than asserted:**
`gHashTag/trinity/apps/website/specs/catalog/onboarding.t27` generates
`https://t27.ai/llms.txt` and `https://t27.ai/agents.t27` byte-identically
(`gHashTag/trinity/apps/website/public/agents.t27`), gated in CI as
`check:onboarding`. The generator evaluates the spec's own `test` blocks --
`typecheck.ok` stays true for `assert 1 > 2`, so a compiler saying "this parses"
is not a compiler saying "this is true" -- and re-compiles the rendered document
before writing it.

**The full rule lives in exactly one place: the `own-language-first` skill**
(`~/.claude/skills/own-language-first/SKILL.md`). It carries the consent gate for
documents addressed to other people's agents, the six negative controls, and the
`;`-alone-on-a-line trap that silently discards a `module` declaration. This
section is a pointer, not a copy -- the recorded defect in this codebase family
is the hand-copied rule that only two of its three homes knew about.

## Actors, not threads (owner rule, 2026-10-08)

The Queen and the swarm move to the actor model.

- Everything that runs at the same time is an actor. That covers a round, a reviewer, a poller and a runner lane. Each one has a pid, a bounded mailbox and a supervisor.
- Queen or swarm work gets no new `setInterval` loop, thread pool or worker counter.
- An existing loop is replaced only after an MVP, its tests, and a benchmark against the current loop on the same input. The numbers are posted on gHashTag/t27#7851.

The Queen server lives in gHashTag/trios, on branches `queen` and `queen-runners`. The gHashTag/BrowserOS fork holds the browser extension and nothing else.

The full rule is in [gHashTag/t27 `AGENTS.md`, "Actors, not threads"](https://github.com/gHashTag/t27/blob/master/AGENTS.md#actors-not-threads-owner-rule-2026-10-08). This section points to it; it is not a copy.
