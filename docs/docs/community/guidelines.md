## Development Workflow 🔄

Trinity follows a **strict specification-first development paradigm**. This ensures quality, consistency, and mathematical rigor.

### The Golden Chain (17-Link Cycle)

Every contribution follows the mandatory 17-link development cycle. Run `tri pipeline run` to execute the full cycle, or follow these steps manually:

<div class="theorem-card">
<h4>Specification-First Development</h4>

All code MUST be generated from `.vibee` specifications. The specification is the **source of truth** — never edit generated code directly.

</div>

| Link | Phase | Action | Command |
|------|-------|--------|---------|
| 0 | Analyze | Understand the problem | Review docs, existing specs |
| 1 | Research | Study prior art and mathematics | Read papers, analyze algorithms |
| 2 | Spec | Write `.vibee` specification | Create `specs/tri/feature.vibee` |
| 3 | Validate | Check specification correctness | `tri spec_validate <file.vibee>` |
| 4 | Decompose | Break into sub-tasks | `tri decompose <task>` |
| 5 | Plan | Generate implementation plan | `tri plan <task>` |
| 6 | Spec-Create | Create spec from template | `tri spec_create <name>` |
| 7 | Verify-Unit | Run unit tests | `zig build test` |
| 8 | Verify-Integ | Run integration tests | `zig build test` |
| 9 | Verify-E2E | Run end-to-end tests | `tri verify` |
| 10 | Verify-Perf | Run performance benchmarks | `tri bench` |
| 11 | Verify-Load | Run load testing | Custom scripts |
| 12 | Verdict | Generate critical assessment | `tri verdict` |
| 13 | Tech-Tree | Propose 3 next steps | Manual (see below) |
| 14 | Document | Update documentation | Edit `docsite/` files |
| 15 | Commit | Create atomic commit | `tri commit "<message>"` |
| 16 | Deploy | Deploy to production | Manual or CI |
| 17 | Loop-Decide | Decide to continue or exit | `tri loop-decide [mode]` |

### Quick Start Workflow

For small changes, you can use the minimal workflow:

```bash
# Step 1: Create specification
cat > specs/tri/my_feature.vibee << 'EOF'
name: my_feature
version: "1.0.0"
language: zig
module: my_feature

types:
  MyType:
    fields:
      value: Int

behaviors:
  - name: my_function
    given: A MyType instance
    when: Calling my_function
    then: Returns transformed value
EOF

# Step 2: Generate code
tri gen specs/tri/my_feature.vibee

# Step 3: Test
zig build test

# Step 4: Run full verification
tri verify

# Step 5: Generate verdict (Critical Assessment)
tri verdict

# Step 6: Commit
tri commit "feat: add my_feature specification"

# Step 7: Submit PR
gh pr create --title "feat: add my_feature" --body-file PR_TEMPLATE.md
```

### Ralph Autonomous Development

For automated development, use **Ralph** — our autonomous development agent:

```bash
# Start Ralph in monitoring mode
ralph --monitor

# Ralph will:
# 1. Read .ralph/fix_plan.md for current tasks
# 2. Execute the 17-link Golden Chain cycle
# 3. Enforce quality gates (build + test + format)
# 4. Update TECH_TREE.md and memory files
# 5. Loop until EXIT_SIGNAL is satisfied
```

### Scope

The scope indicates the module or component affected:

| Scope | Module |
|-------|--------|
| `vsa` | Vector Symbolic Architecture |
| `vm` | Ternary Virtual Machine |
| `hybrid` | HybridBigInt (packed trit encoding) |
| `firebird` | LLM inference engine |
| `vibee` | VIBEE compiler |
| `depin` | DePIN infrastructure |
| `cli` | TRI CLI tool |
| `docs` | Documentation |

### Examples

```bash
# Simple commit
git commit -m "feat(vsa): add sparse vector bundle operation"

# Complex commit with body
git commit -m "feat(vsa): add sparse vector operations

- Implement SparseVector type with index-value encoding
- Add sparse_bundle for efficient sparse representation
- Include test cases for edge cases (empty, full density)
- Performance: 20x faster for density < 0.1

Closes #42"

# Bug fix
git commit -m "fix(vm): prevent stack underflow in conditional jumps

The previous implementation allowed negative stack indices,
causing undefined behavior. Added bounds checking.

Fixes #38"

# Breaking change
git commit -m "feat(vsa)!: change Hypervector dimension default

BREAKING CHANGE: Default dimension changed from 10000 to 8192
for better cache alignment. Users relying on old default must
update their code."
```

### Rules

1. **Use imperative mood**: "add" not "added" or "adds"
2. **Keep subject short**: Under 72 characters
3. **Capitalize subject**: First letter uppercase
5. **Don't end with period**: Subject is a sentence fragment
6. **Reference issues**: Use "Closes #42" or "Refs #38"
7. **One change per commit**: Atomic commits are easier to review
8. **Explain WHY, not WHAT**: Body should provide context

### Before Pushing

```bash
# Check your commits
git log origin/main..HEAD --oneline

# Format should look like:
# feat(vsa): add sparse vector operations
# fix(vm): prevent stack underflow
# docs: update contributing guide
```
